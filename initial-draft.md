I am giving a "KT Meeting" Knowledge Transfer on the 'State of AI 2026.2'. That is, this is a meeting specifically covering the use of agents for software development.
 
A lot of people are using different terms like "agentic engineering", "harness engineering", "compound engineering", "ralph loop", "AI-assisted software engineering", etc.
 
Last weekend, I finally had time to play catch-up and dive into the madness to experience it hands-on.
 
Here is my simple "ElmishPaint" weekend demo project (https://github.com/rastreus/ElmishPaint) on GitHub.
 
I have provided a list of references with URLs in the `references.md` markdown document.
 
Here's what I am wanting. Please review the links and URL references and then create an outline of a simple, casual KT meeting presentation. Here's what I'm trying to get across: there's a lot of different technical jargon right now because a single idiomatic term hasn't yet been coin, but everyone, i.e. the software engineering landscape, is moving in the same direction. Like the GLM-5 introductory blog title says "From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering", the agentic tools and LLM models are now quickly becoming capable for real engineering. 'Vibe Coding' was considered a "toy" for non-practitioners to create AI slop, but we have turned the corner where these tools can now be used for real-world, Production development when they are harnessed correctly. The engineer then become an "Architect" directing the agents and instilling human-quality best practices of guardrail constraints through rigorous architecture, methodology and testing. When you can 'close the loop', the agent is particularly capable.
 
Please create a refinement of these thoughts, reinforced by the references as a markdown document. Then, please also create a meeting outline that can be used to create a simple slideshow. Lastly, craft a prompt that will be given to an agent to use the meeting outline to use `Marp` to create a slideshow presentation.

There are several popular open source tools for creating slideshow presentations directly from Markdown files. Here are some of the most widely used ones:

| Tool       | Description                                                                 | Key Features                                      | Website / Repo                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Marp**  | A dedicated Markdown Presentation Ecosystem; one of the most intuitive and feature-rich options for converting Markdown to slides. | CLI tool, VS Code extension, exports to HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint; custom themes; auto-preview. | [marp.app](https://marp.app/)          |
| **Remark** | A simple, in-browser slideshow tool driven entirely by Markdown.           | Lightweight, no build step required; runs in any browser; supports speaker notes and syntax highlighting. | [remarkjs.com](https://remarkjs.com/)  |
| **Reveal.js** | Powerful HTML presentation framework with built-in Markdown support (often used via wrappers like reveal-md). | Nested slides, transitions, PDF export; highly customizable with plugins. | [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/)  |
| **Slidev** | Modern tool aimed at developers, using Markdown with Vue components.        | Live coding, themes, recording; great for tech talks. | [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/)            |

Marp is often recommended as a go-to choice for its ease of use and export options, especially if you want a standalone CLI or editor integration. If you're looking for something terminal-based, tools like presenterm or lookatme are also available but less common for full slideshows. 

Which one fits your needs best depends on whether you prefer browser-based, CLI, or advanced features—feel free to provide more details!

The `shinji-chair-bg.png` image should be used as the title slide to represent that the current Agents landscape can be dizzying and overwhelming.
